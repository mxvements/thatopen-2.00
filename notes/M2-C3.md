## C3 - L1 - Introducing  bundling and the package manager

+ Introducing bundling and the package manager: The concept of bundling is introduced as a method to consolidate separate JavaScript files into one, making it easier to manage code. Bundling is essential for web development, even though browsers prefer a single file. This process is facilitated by bundlers, which are tools or libraries, and the integration is made possible through package managers like Yarn, NPM, or PNPM.

+ Installing NPM: To install NPM, developers are directed to the Node.js website. Node.js, though primarily used for backend development, is necessary for NPM. The terminal is introduced as a powerful tool to interact with the computer.

+ Initializing NPM: Developers initialize NPM by running npm init -y in the terminal, creating a package.json file. This file keeps track of the packages the project uses.

+ Introduction to Bundlers: The need for bundling is emphasized, and various bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel are mentioned. However, a new package, Vite, is introduced as a more user-friendly frontend tooling package that includes a preconfigured bundler (Rollup).

+ Installing Vite: Vite is installed using the command npm i vite --save-dev. The addition of Vite as a development dependency is reflected in the package.json file, and a new node_modules folder is created.

+ Understanding Node Modules: The node_modules folder is explained as the location where all files needed by dependencies are stored. Developers are advised not to modify this folder directly.

+ Creating an NPM Script: An NPM script is introduced as a way to name commands for execution in the terminal. The script “dev” is created, linked to the vite command, and can be run using npm run dev. This script launches a local server provided by Vite for testing the application.

+ Launching the Development Server: Running npm run dev in the terminal initiates the local server, providing a more optimized and faster alternative to traditional methods like "open with live server." Control-clicking the link provided in the terminal opens the browser with the app being developed.
