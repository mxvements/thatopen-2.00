# C3 - Introducing advanced code to the projects page

## C3 - L1 - Introducing  bundling and the package manager

+ Introducing bundling and the package manager: The concept of bundling is introduced as a method to consolidate separate JavaScript files into one, making it easier to manage code. Bundling is essential for web development, even though browsers prefer a single file. This process is facilitated by bundlers, which are tools or libraries, and the integration is made possible through package managers like Yarn, NPM, or PNPM.

+ Installing NPM: To install NPM, developers are directed to the Node.js website. Node.js, though primarily used for backend development, is necessary for NPM. The terminal is introduced as a powerful tool to interact with the computer.

+ Initializing NPM: Developers initialize NPM by running npm init -y in the terminal, creating a package.json file. This file keeps track of the packages the project uses.

+ Introduction to Bundlers: The need for bundling is emphasized, and various bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel are mentioned. However, a new package, Vite, is introduced as a more user-friendly frontend tooling package that includes a preconfigured bundler (Rollup).

+ Installing Vite: Vite is installed using the command npm i vite --save-dev. The addition of Vite as a development dependency is reflected in the package.json file, and a new node_modules folder is created.

+ Understanding Node Modules: The node_modules folder is explained as the location where all files needed by dependencies are stored. Developers are advised not to modify this folder directly.

+ Creating an NPM Script: An NPM script is introduced as a way to name commands for execution in the terminal. The script “dev” is created, linked to the vite command, and can be run using npm run dev. This script launches a local server provided by Vite for testing the application.

+ Launching the Development Server: Running npm run dev in the terminal initiates the local server, providing a more optimized and faster alternative to traditional methods like "open with live server." Control-clicking the link provided in the terminal opens the browser with the app being developed.

## C3 - L2 - Creating a project class

+ Creating a project class: The lesson begins by discussing the relocation of the JavaScript index file to a new folder. It emphasizes the necessity of updating file paths referencing the moved file, specifically in the HTML.

+ Defining the Project Class: The class syntax in JavaScript is introduced. It involves using the class keyword, naming the class in Pascal Case, and defining properties within curly braces. The class is considered an object template with properties and methods.

+ Constructor Method: The constructor method is explained. It is automatically invoked each time a new instance of the class is created. The lesson demonstrates accepting arguments in the constructor, showcasing how to log the provided name to the console.

+ Instance Creation and Export: The goal is clarified: each time a user fills out the new project form, a new instance of the class should be created. Import and export statements are introduced to facilitate using the class definition in other files.

+ Importing the Class: The import syntax is explained. It involves using the import keyword, curly braces for named imports, and specifying the path relative to the current file. The HTML script tag is updated with the type attribute set to module to signify the use of separate files (modules).

+ Creating an Instance: In the index file, the lesson demonstrates creating a new instance of the project class when the form is submitted. The console log of the project name is removed, and a new instance is created without logging the name to the console.

+ Instance Data Initialization: The lesson acknowledges the goal is to store form information inside the project instance. It logs the newly created instance to the console, revealing that all properties are undefined.

+ Assigning Values in the Constructor: To assign values to instance properties, the constructor is modified to accept an object with project data. Using the this keyword, the lesson sets the instance properties to the corresponding values from the passed object.

+ Issue Identification: An exercise is introduced, asking the viewer to pause the video and identify an issue in the code. The problem is revealed to be a missing assignment of the input data to the class instance.

+ Correcting the Issue: The lesson rectifies the problem by passing the constructed projectData object to the constructor, renaming it for clarity.

+ Result Verification: The corrected code is tested in the browser by filling out the form, resulting in the console log displaying the project information correctly.

## C3 - L3 - Introducing TS to the code 

+ Introducing Typescript to the code: The code initially adds two numbers, a and b, together. Upon execution with a given pair of numbers, the console logs 15, reflecting the sum of 5 and 10. However, an issue arises when changing the number 10 to the string 10.

+ Dynamic Typing in JavaScript: Three observations are made:

	+ There is no restriction preventing the change of a number to a string.

	+ The result, now 510, is incorrect.

	+ No error is triggered when attempting to sum a number with a string.

+ Dynamically Typed Programming: The ability to freely change the data type of values at any time is identified as dynamically typed programming. JavaScript exemplifies this, allowing the alteration of data types, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

+ Type Expectations in Functions: The goal is to define the exact data types expected at inputs a and b in the addNumbers function. While hovering over the getElementById function, the expected string data type is visible, providing a warning if a number is passed.

+ Transition to TypeScript: TypeScript is introduced to shift from dynamically typed programming to statically typed programming. TypeScript allows for the definition of expected data types, aiding in preventing errors.

+ TypeScript Installation: TypeScript is installed as a development dependency in the project using the command npm i typescript --save-dev. It's noted that Vite already configures TypeScript, and the development server is restarted.

+ Usage of TypeScript: The transition involves changing the file extension from .js to .ts. It's emphasized that TypeScript usually requires configuration, but Vite takes care of this. Additionally, browsers don't understand TypeScript directly, so the files are compiled to JavaScript by Vite.

+ Initial Observations with TypeScript: After changing the extension to .ts, TypeScript highlights areas that might need attention. The any data type for the a argument in the addNumbers function is refined to number.

+ Data Type Mismatch Warning: The mismatch of providing a string instead of a number for the b argument in the addNumbers function triggers a TypeScript warning. The correction involves converting the string back to a number.

+ Example Cleanup: Acknowledging that the addNumbers function was an example, it is removed from the code.

+ Modal Show Method Issue: An issue with the showModal method is identified. The modal object, an HTMLElement, does not inherently have this method. TypeScript warns that this method may not exist in all cases.

+ Type Guard with instanceof: To address the issue, a type guard is introduced using the instanceof keyword. This guards against invoking the showModal method unless modal is of type HTMLDialogElement. The logical AND operator (&&) ensures both conditions are met before invoking the method.

+ TypeScript's Contribution to Error Prevention: The use of TypeScript in the code is highlighted for providing warnings and enhancing error prevention, exemplified by the improved handling of the showModal method.

## C3 - L4 - Using custom types for the Project class 

+ Using custom types for the Project class: Transitioning to TypeScript in the Project class file involves changing its extension to .ts. The initial step is defining datatypes for each property in the object, denoted by three dots preceding each property.

+ Datatypes Explanation: For the name and description properties, the string datatype is straightforward. However, the status and userRole properties have a fixed set of options, utilizing the OR syntax in TypeScript for a choice between predefined string values (e.g., "pending," "active," "finished"). The Date datatype is introduced for the finishDate property, which handles date-related information.

+ Introducing TypeScript Interfaces: TypeScript interfaces, named with the I convention, are introduced to describe datatypes for each property of an object. An interface named IProject is created at the top of the file, ensuring that the class adheres to specific types.

+ Implementing Interfaces: The implements keyword is utilized in the class to enforce adherence to the IProject interface. If any required properties are missing or mismatched, TypeScript issues warnings during development.

+ Exporting and Using Interfaces: The IProject interface is exported and then imported in the index file. It is applied to the projectData object, ensuring it adheres to the defined datatype.

+ Addressing Type Mismatches: TypeScript warnings arise in the object keys due to discrepancies between expected and provided datatypes. The as keyword, indicating Type Assertion, is used carefully to treat values as their specified types.

+ Handling Description and Type Assertion: Similar Type Assertion is applied to the description property, ensuring TypeScript treats it as a string. Custom types ProjectStatus and UserRole are defined to represent fixed values for the status and userRole properties.

+ Using Custom Types: The created custom types (ProjectStatus and UserRole) are exported from the file, imported in the index file, and used for Type Assertion to maintain datatype consistency.

+ Type Assertion for Finish Date: The finishDate property requires a specific datatype for TypeScript compliance. A syntax that conforms to TypeScript expectations is employed, ensuring proper handling of the property.

## C3 - L5 - Creating project cards from code

+ Creating project cards from code: The global document object, often used for DOM manipulation, allows the creation of UI elements using the createElement method. Here, a div element is created as it serves as a container for project card UIs.

+ Storing UI Reference in Class: A new property is introduced in the project class to store the UI created for it. This property is created within the class, satisfying class internals rather than the IProject interface.

+ Setting Inner HTML for UI: The innerHTML property of HTMLElements is utilized to define the HTML syntax for the content of the UI element. The HTML content is constructed using back-ticks to create multi-line strings, allowing dynamic content insertion using template literals.

+ Dynamic Content Insertion: Template literals or template strings are employed for dynamic content insertion, replacing placeholders with actual values from the Project instance being created. This allows for dynamic updates of values like project name, description, cost, and estimated progress.

+ Default Values for Unspecified Properties: Default values are assigned to properties like cost and estimated progress, which might not be specified during project creation. This ensures that these properties have values even if not provided during instantiation.

+ Class and ID Assignment: The project card container is assigned the class project-card to ensure proper styling. This enhances the visual appearance of the project card UI.

+ Code Readability: A comment is added to separate concerns and enhance code readability. The constructor code is organized to improve clarity, considering potential future additions that might impact code readability.

+ Introducing UI Creation Method: To address potential readability issues with a lengthy constructor, a method named setUI is introduced to specifically handle the creation of the project card UI. The method is defined similarly to a property, distinguishing it as a class method.

+ Invoking UI Creation Method: The setUI method is manually invoked inside the constructor to ensure the UI is created as soon as a new instance of the class is instantiated.

+ Preventing Duplicate UI Creation: To prevent multiple UI creations for the same project instance, an if statement is introduced inside the setUI method. If the UI property is already defined, the method ends, ensuring the UI is not recreated unnecessarily.

+ Return Statement in Methods: The return statement is utilized within the setUI method to exit the method if the UI property is already defined. This enhances the efficiency of UI creation and avoids redundancy.

## C3 - L6 - Managing the projects

+ Projects Manager: This class is introduced to manage projects and has a list property to keep a reference to all projects. The Project class is imported, and the list is typed as an array of Project instances with a default value of an empty list,

+ New Project Method: A new class method called newProject is created. It utilizes the push method to insert a new project into the list and returns the newly created project.

+ Integration with ProjectsManager: In the index file, the ProjectsManager class is imported, and an instance is created. The direct creation of projects in the submit event callback is replaced with a call to the newProject method of the projects manager.

+ Rendering Projects in UI: The ProjectsManager class is extended to include a UI property of type HTMLDivElement to serve as the container for all project cards. In the constructor, an argument is added to specify the HTML container. After creating a project, the append method is used to render the project in the specified UI container.

+ Integration with Index File: In the index file, a reference to the projects list in the HTML document is obtained. TypeScript complains about a potential null value, and type assertion is used for simplicity. The obtained reference is then passed as an argument when creating an instance of the ProjectsManager class.

+ Form Cleanup and Closing Modal: After form submission, the reset method is used to clean up the form, and a new closeModal function is introduced to close the modal. The showModal function is duplicated and modified to become the closeModal function. The form is then closed after submission.

+ Assignment for Learners: Learners are encouraged to create a custom function that toggles the modal's visibility based on a dedicated argument. The solution can be shared in the comments.

+ Button Types in HTML: The HTML form's submit button is set to type "submit" to indicate its role in form submission. The cancel button is set to type "button" to prevent the form from being submitted when clicked.

+ Behavior of Cancel Button: An issue is identified where clicking the cancel button has the same behavior as clicking the accept button, resulting in the creation of a project. The solution involves setting the type of the cancel button to "button" to prevent form submission.
