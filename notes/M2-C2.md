# M2 - C2 - Coding the basics for the projects page

## M2 - C2 - L1 - Referencing DOM elements using JS
 + User Interaction for New Project: Emphasizing the app's focus on user interaction, the lesson initiates a basic interaction to display a form when the "New Project" button is clicked. It prompts users to start the live server by right-clicking the HTML file.

 + CSS Selectors in JavaScript: Drawing parallels to CSS, the lesson highlights the need to use selectors in JavaScript to reference elements in the HTML file. It signals that various methods exist to reference HTML elements from JavaScript.

 + Understanding Objects in Programming: Introduces the fundamental concept of objects in programming, emphasizing that objects are data structures holding descriptive information. The syntax and structure of objects are discussed, along with the use of key-value pairs.

 + Fundamental Data Types: Covers the five fundamental data types in programming: string, number, boolean, array, and objects. Each type is explained with examples, providing a foundational understanding of these data structures.

 + Functions and Methods in Objects: Reiterates the concept of functions as reusable sets of instructions in programming. Highlights that objects can store functions, referred to as methods, and provides an example of a method called celebrateBirthday.

 + Pre-existing Objects in the Browser: In the context of web development, particularly in the browser, the lesson reveals that there are predefined objects for use. Focuses on the document object, accessible in JavaScript, which aids in interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM).

 + Dot Notation and Accessing Properties: Introduces the dot notation, a fundamental concept in programming, to access properties and methods stored in objects. Shows that using document dot provides access to properties and methods in the document object.

 + Using getElementById Method: Demonstrates the usage of the getElementById method provided by the document object to retrieve an element from the DOM based on a given ID. Explains the importance of IDEs and intellisense for code assistance.

 + Understanding Function Arguments and Return Types: Analyzes the getElementById method, emphasizing its need for an argument (in this case, elementId) and specifying the return type. Discusses that the return type can be HTMLElement or null depending on the presence of the given ID in the HTML file.

 + Setting Comments in JavaScript: Introduces commenting in JavaScript using // for single-line comments and /**/ for multi-line comments. Encourages adding comments to code based on the provided explanations and one's understanding.

 + Example Comment in Code: Concludes by suggesting users add comments to their code, providing an example comment to annotate the usage of the getElementById method in the HTML file.

## M2 - C2 - L2 - Working with events and functions

+ Storing Element Reference in a Variable: To efficiently reuse the reference to a button element without repeatedly using document.getElementById("new-projects-btn"), the lesson stores the result of the function in a variable. Using const, a reserved keyword indicating a constant variable, the variable is named newProjectsBtn.

+ Variable Naming Conventions: The lesson briefly discusses variable naming conventions. It highlights the use of camelCase or PascalCase and advises against using reserved words as variable names.

+ Accessing Element Properties and Methods: Demonstrating the power of variables, the lesson shows that after the newProjectsBtn reference, a dot reveals all available properties and methods that can be accessed from the HTMLElement object.

+ Introduction to Events: Introducing events in programming, the lesson defines an event as a signal indicating that something has happened, often sent after the execution of a function. Events, particularly in the DOM, occur when users interact with elements, like clicking a button.

+ addEventListener Method: Explaining the handling of events, the lesson introduces the addEventListener method in HTML elements. This method takes two arguments: the name of the triggered event (e.g., "click") and the function to execute when the event occurs.

+ Writing Functions in JavaScript: The lesson introduces three ways to write functions in JavaScript. The first method employs an arrow syntax to create an anonymous function. The second method converts an anonymous function into a regular function by storing it in a constant. The third method is the traditional way of defining functions using the function keyword.

+ Function Example: Providing an example, the lesson creates a function named showModal using the arrow syntax. This function invokes the showModal method on an HTMLElement object, in this case, a dialog tag.

+ Converting Anonymous Functions to Regular Functions: The lesson demonstrates converting an anonymous function to a regular function by storing it in a constant and passing it as an argument to addEventListener. It emphasizes not using parentheses when passing the function as an argument.

+ Traditional Function Definition: The lesson introduces the traditional way of defining functions using the function keyword, naming the function, setting parameters in parentheses, and defining the function's code within curly braces.

+ Referencing JavaScript File in HTML: To incorporate the JavaScript file into the HTML, the lesson instructs adding a script tag before the closing body tag. The src attribute points to the location of the JavaScript file.

+ Error Checking in Developer Tools: The lesson suggests using the browser's developer tools, particularly the console tab, for error checking. In case of unexpected behavior, checking the console can provide insights into errors.
